<div id=storybook style=display:none><pre id=story1 data-title="The Wolf And The Lamb">
WOLF, meeting with a Lamb astray from the fold, resolved not to lay
violent hands on him, but to find some plea to justify to the Lamb the
Wolf's right to eat him. He thus addressed him: "Sirrah, last year you
grossly insulted me." "Indeed," bleated the Lamb in a mournful tone
of voice, "I was not then born." Then said the Wolf, "You feed in my
pasture." "No, good sir," replied the Lamb, "I have not yet tasted
grass." Again said the Wolf, "You drink of my well." "No," exclaimed the
Lamb, "I never yet drank water, for as yet my mother's milk is both food
and drink to me." Upon which the Wolf seized him and ate him up, saying,
"Well! I won't remain supperless, even though you refute every one of my
imputations." The tyrant will always find a pretext for his tyranny.

<pre id=story2 data-title="The Bat And The Weasels">
A BAT who fell upon the ground and was caught by a Weasel pleaded to be
spared his life. The Weasel refused, saying that he was by nature the
enemy of all birds. The Bat assured him that he was not a bird, but a
mouse, and thus was set free. Shortly afterwards the Bat again fell to
the ground and was caught by another Weasel, whom he likewise entreated
not to eat him. The Weasel said that he had a special hostility to
mice. The Bat assured him that he was not a mouse, but a bat, and thus a
second time escaped.

It is wise to turn circumstances to good account.

<pre id=story3 data-title="The Ass And The Grasshopper">
AN ASS having heard some Grasshoppers chirping, was highly enchanted;
and, desiring to possess the same charms of melody, demanded what sort
of food they lived on to give them such beautiful voices. They replied,
"The dew." The Ass resolved that he would live only upon dew, and in a
short time died of hunger.

<pre id=story4 data-title="The Lion And The Mouse">
A LION was awakened from sleep by a Mouse running over his face. Rising
up angrily, he caught him and was about to kill him, when the Mouse
piteously entreated, saying: "If you would only spare my life, I would
be sure to repay your kindness." The Lion laughed and let him go. It
happened shortly after this that the Lion was caught by some hunters,
who bound him by strong ropes to the ground. The Mouse, recognizing
his roar, came and gnawed the rope with his teeth, and set him free,
exclaiming:

"You ridiculed the idea of my ever being able to help you, not expecting
to receive from me any repayment of your favor; now you know that it is
possible for even a Mouse to confer benefits on a Lion."

<pre id=story5 data-title="The Charcoal-Burner And The Fuller">
A CHARCOAL-BURNER carried on his trade in his own house. One day he met
a friend, a Fuller, and entreated him to come and live with him, saying
that they should be far better neighbors and that their housekeeping
expenses would be lessened. The Fuller replied, "The arrangement is
impossible as far as I am concerned, for whatever I should whiten, you
would immediately blacken again with your charcoal."

Like will draw like.

<pre id=story6 data-title="The Father And His Sons">
A FATHER had a family of sons who were perpetually quarreling among
themselves. When he failed to heal their disputes by his exhortations,
he determined to give them a practical illustration of the evils of
disunion; and for this purpose he one day told them to bring him a
bundle of sticks. When they had done so, he placed the faggot into the
hands of each of them in succession, and ordered them to break it in
pieces. They tried with all their strength, and were not able to do it.
He next opened the faggot, took the sticks separately, one by one, and
again put them into his sons' hands, upon which they broke them easily.
He then addressed them in these words: "My sons, if you are of one mind,
and unite to assist each other, you will be as this faggot, uninjured
by all the attempts of your enemies; but if you are divided among
yourselves, you will be broken as easily as these sticks."

<pre id=story7 data-title="The Boy Hunting Locusts">
A BOY was hunting for locusts. He had caught a goodly number, when he
saw a Scorpion, and mistaking him for a locust, reached out his hand to
take him. The Scorpion, showing his sting, said: "If you had but touched
me, my friend, you would have lost me, and all your locusts too!"

<pre id=story8 data-title="The Cock and the Jewel">
A COCK, scratching for food for himself and his hens, found a precious
stone and exclaimed: "If your owner had found thee, and not I, he would
have taken thee up, and have set thee in thy first estate; but I have
found thee for no purpose. I would rather have one barleycorn than all
the jewels in the world."

<pre id=story9 data-title="The Wolf and the Crane">
A WOLF who had a bone stuck in his throat hired a Crane, for a large
sum, to put her head into his mouth and draw out the bone. When the
Crane had extracted the bone and demanded the promised payment, the
Wolf, grinning and grinding his teeth, exclaimed: "Why, you have surely
already had a sufficient recompense, in having been permitted to draw
out your head in safety from the mouth and jaws of a wolf."

In serving the wicked, expect no reward, and be thankful if you escape
injury for your pains.

<pre id=story10 data-title="Hercules and the Wagoner">
A CARTER was driving a wagon along a country lane, when the wheels sank
down deep into a rut. The rustic driver, stupefied and aghast, stood
looking at the wagon, and did nothing but utter loud cries to Hercules
to come and help him. Hercules, it is said, appeared and thus addressed
him: "Put your shoulders to the wheels, my man. Goad on your bullocks,
and never more pray to me for help, until you have done your best to
help yourself, or depend upon it you will henceforth pray in vain."

Self-help is the best help.

<pre id=story11 data-title="The Ants and the Grasshopper">
THE ANTS were spending a fine winter's day drying grain collected in
the summertime. A Grasshopper, perishing with famine, passed by and
earnestly begged for a little food. The Ants inquired of him, "Why did
you not treasure up food during the summer?" He replied, "I had not
leisure enough. I passed the days in singing." They then said in
derision: "If you were foolish enough to sing all the summer, you must
dance supperless to bed in the winter."

<pre id=story12 data-title="The Traveler and His Dog">
A TRAVELER about to set out on a journey saw his Dog stand at the
door stretching himself. He asked him sharply: "Why do you stand there
gaping? Everything is ready but you, so come with me instantly." The
Dog, wagging his tail, replied: "O, master! I am quite ready; it is you
for whom I am waiting."

The loiterer often blames delay on his more active friend.

<pre id=story13 data-title="The Dog and the Shadow">
A DOG, crossing a bridge over a stream with a piece of flesh in his
mouth, saw his own shadow in the water and took it for that of another
Dog, with a piece of meat double his own in size. He immediately let go
of his own, and fiercely attacked the other Dog to get his larger piece
from him. He thus lost both: that which he grasped at in the water,
because it was a shadow; and his own, because the stream swept it away.

<pre id=story14 data-title="The Mole and His Mother">
A MOLE, a creature blind from birth, once said to his Mother: "I am sure
than I can see, Mother!" In the desire to prove to him his mistake, his
Mother placed before him a few grains of frankincense, and asked, "What
is it?" The young Mole said, "It is a pebble." His Mother exclaimed:
"My son, I am afraid that you are not only blind, but that you have lost
your sense of smell."

<pre id=story15 data-title="The Herdsman and the Lost Bull
">
A HERDSMAN tending his flock in a forest lost a Bull-calf from the fold.
After a long and fruitless search, he made a vow that, if he could only
discover the thief who had stolen the Calf, he would offer a lamb in
sacrifice to Hermes, Pan, and the Guardian Deities of the forest. Not
long afterwards, as he ascended a small hillock, he saw at its foot a
Lion feeding on the Calf. Terrified at the sight, he lifted his eyes and
his hands to heaven, and said: "Just now I vowed to offer a lamb to the
Guardian Deities of the forest if I could only find out who had robbed
me; but now that I have discovered the thief, I would willingly add a
full-grown Bull to the Calf I have lost, if I may only secure my own
escape from him in safety."

<pre id=story16 data-title="The Hare and the Tortoise">
A HARE one day ridiculed the short feet and slow pace of the Tortoise,
who replied, laughing: "Though you be swift as the wind, I will beat you
in a race." The Hare, believing her assertion to be simply impossible,
assented to the proposal; and they agreed that the Fox should choose
the course and fix the goal. On the day appointed for the race the two
started together. The Tortoise never for a moment stopped, but went on
with a slow but steady pace straight to the end of the course. The Hare,
lying down by the wayside, fell fast asleep. At last waking up, and
moving as fast as he could, he saw the Tortoise had reached the goal,
and was comfortably dozing after her fatigue.

Slow but steady wins the race.

<pre id=story17 data-title="The Farmer and the Stork">
A FARMER placed nets on his newly-sown plowlands and caught a number
of Cranes, which came to pick up his seed. With them he trapped a Stork
that had fractured his leg in the net and was earnestly beseeching the
Farmer to spare his life. "Pray save me, Master," he said, "and let me
go free this once. My broken limb should excite your pity. Besides, I
am no Crane, I am a Stork, a bird of excellent character; and see how I
love and slave for my father and mother. Look too, at my feathers--they
are not the least like those of a Crane." The Farmer laughed aloud and
said, "It may be all as you say, I only know this: I have taken you with
these robbers, the Cranes, and you must die in their company."

Birds of a feather flock together.

<pre id=story18 data-title="The Farmer and the Snake">
ONE WINTER a Farmer found a Snake stiff and frozen with cold. He had
compassion on it, and taking it up, placed it in his bosom. The Snake
was quickly revived by the warmth, and resuming its natural instincts,
bit its benefactor, inflicting on him a mortal wound. "Oh," cried
the Farmer with his last breath, "I am rightly served for pitying a
scoundrel."

The greatest kindness will not bind the ungrateful.

<pre id=story19 data-title="The Fawn and His Mother">
A YOUNG FAWN once said to his Mother, "You are larger than a dog, and
swifter, and more used to running, and you have your horns as a defense;
why, then, O Mother! do the hounds frighten you so?" She smiled, and
said: "I know full well, my son, that all you say is true. I have the
advantages you mention, but when I hear even the bark of a single dog I
feel ready to faint, and fly away as fast as I can."

No arguments will give courage to the coward.

<pre id=story20 data-title="The Swallow and the Crow">
THE SWALLOW and the Crow had a contention about their plumage. The Crow
put an end to the dispute by saying, "Your feathers are all very well in
the spring, but mine protect me against the winter."

Fair weather friends are not worth much.

<pre id=story21 data-title="The Mountain in Labor">
A MOUNTAIN was once greatly agitated. Loud groans and noises were heard,
and crowds of people came from all parts to see what was the matter.
While they were assembled in anxious expectation of some terrible
calamity, out came a Mouse.

Don't make much ado about nothing.

<pre id=story22 data-title="The Tortoise and the Eagle">
A TORTOISE, lazily basking in the sun, complained to the sea-birds of
her hard fate, that no one would teach her to fly. An Eagle, hovering
near, heard her lamentation and demanded what reward she would give him
if he would take her aloft and float her in the air. "I will give you,"
she said, "all the riches of the Red Sea." "I will teach you to fly
then," said the Eagle; and taking her up in his talons he carried her
almost to the clouds suddenly he let her go, and she fell on a lofty
mountain, dashing her shell to pieces. The Tortoise exclaimed in the
moment of death: "I have deserved my present fate; for what had I to do
with wings and clouds, who can with difficulty move about on the earth?"

If men had all they wished, they would be often ruined.
